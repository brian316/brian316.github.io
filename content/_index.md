<!-- # Welcome to my blog! -->

You found me! Care to look around?

I've spent over six years building and shipping full-stack applications in the cloud, with a strong focus on back-end development—things like databases, writing core logic, and keeping code clean and maintainable. I'm big on problem-solving and always looking for better, smarter ways to do things. I work a lot with Python and really enjoy how flexible and powerful it is, especially for building APIs. I also have experience deploying machine learning models at scale. That said, I'm always open to learning new tools and languages when the project calls for it.
