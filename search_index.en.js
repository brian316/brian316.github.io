Thinking things would go smoothly (somehow they never do) I only had read access to the card. I tried everything from disk utilities First Aid, formatting to exFAT and MS-DOS (FAT), and dangerously typing commands from the interwebs into my terminal... cough, of course I have common sense enough to know what they are doing. Nothing worked. It was simply stuck on readonly mode. I had given up hope and started my amazon return thinking I had a defective device maybe even a fake sd card, but then I used a known working sd card and same issue! I had to dig deeper to find my solution.\nSystem Check\nInsert your sd card and check the volume info\n\nlook for this line. If present you have the issue!\n\n\nUse macbooks Disk Utility to erase/format your sd card to the desired format and take note of that format. For me I needed to use msdos format so it can be read my 3d printer find (Creality Ender-3 v2 Neo).\nSolution\nNow for the hack! We are going to manually mount the disk as a read/write volume.\n\nif using exfat then replace msdos with exfat\n\nConclusion\nLike I said this is a hack so everytime you insert your sdcard you'll have to run the set of commands. Not ideal, but we are programmers or maybe just script kiddies so just create a script to run whenever you need it.
